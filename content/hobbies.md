        work life balance is fucking hard - creative outlets are a great means to decompress and connect with others.

        ## Mixing
        I like to mix music sometimes (preferably from a quiet bedroom). I was an unknown [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/dj_filo) DJ in college and would perform at the occasional party or bar. Nowadays I do 2-3 performances a year and typically just mix for close friends.


        ## Photography
        I like to take noob photos of different animals, landscapes, and people that I encounter while travelling this vast planet. See [here](https://vsco.co/epociask/gallery) for a look at some of my favorites :)
